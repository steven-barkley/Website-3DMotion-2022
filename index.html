			<p>Guess I'll just talk about the different types of braids...</p>
			<p>Hi, welcome to this page. Here I'm talking about the different types of 
		braids.</p>
			<p>Women braid their hair for several reasons. It keeps hair out of the way and
		it looks lovely, in our opinion. Some cultures have had women braid their
		hair to indicate marital status or something like that. (Need more on the history
		and purpose of braids here, some research needed.) Without further ado, here
		are several styles of braids out there. Some of these are easy to do, 
		some of them need more practice and effort to get done right. </p>

				1. The regular 3-strand braid
				
				<p>Now here's a classic and easy-to-do braid. This is the first type of 
				braid that women tend to learn, I think, and I remember this being the
				first one I learned myself.</p>

				2. The fishtail braid
				
				<p>This braid is easier to do at the side rather than at the back, though
				you can certainly do it at the back of your head. Basically with this one,
				it's like doing a regular braid, but you cross sections of one strand of hair
				over to the other repeatedly. </p>

				3. The french braid
				
				<p>This braid is kind of like the regular 3-strand braid mentioned above, but you 
				start at the top of the back of your head, add hair from each side as you braid
				from there, and then braid the rest of your hair the regular way when you get to 
				the nape of your neck. This type of braid is great for keeping your hair out of
				the way when you travel or work out, but it can be for when you're not doing either
				as well. I personally could never get this one right even with a french braiding
				tool, until I found an easier way to do it on YouTube.</p>
